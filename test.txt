To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
